Hi! My name is Nicholas. I'm a graduate from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor's of Science in Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics.

In my spare time I am learning how to collaborate on open-source projects and trying to get a few of my own ideas from off the backburner and into workable code.

I would love to hear how I might be able to help in any project. You can reach out to me through my Linkedin profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasmilligan/
